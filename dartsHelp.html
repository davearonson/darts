<p><dt>What <i>is</i> DARTS?

<p><dd>DARTS is a helper for <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/"
target="_new">Toastmasters</a> clubs.  In particular, it helps the Vice
President of Education, or whoever it is that assigns meeting roles.  It can
also be useful for anyone else who wants to look at who did what when in the
past.  If you are not in <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/"
target="_new">Toastmasters</a>, you are not going to find DARTS useful.  In
fact, if you are not in a <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/"
target="_new">Toastmasters</a> club, and specifically one using <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>, you
probably won't be able to run DARTS at all.  (Except for the <a
href="http://www.davearonson.com/darts/darts.html" target="_new">demo</a> at <a
href="http://www.davearonson.com/" target="_new">the author's
web site</a>.)

<p><dt>So what does DARTS <i>do</i>?

<p><dd>Mainly, it figures out whose turn it is to fill what role.  It also can
present a printable agenda, let you look at which current member did what
meeting roles how many times in a given timeslice of your club's past, and
suggest what roles each current member should take.  Lastly, it can also let
you view some raw data, including the past history in <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>'s own
format (which includes lapsed members), the upcoming duty rosters, and DARTS's
own configuration file.

<p><dt><a name="how"></a>How does it decide who should do what?

<p><dd>It looks at the data on your <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>-based club web site, mainly:
<ul>
 <li>who your members are,
 <li>what roles you use,
 <li>who did what roles when in the past,
 <li>who has signed up to do what when in the future,
 <li>and an optional configuration file, which says what roles to assign,
     in what order, and what members are absent long-term.
</ul>

<p>After asking <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> for all this information, DARTS makes a list of
people for each role, sorted by who's done it least recently.  (Sort of.  See
below for the boring details.)  When you tell it to assign roles, it goes
through all the roles, and checks their lists.  The person who appears earliest
on the list, who isn't marked absent, and doesn't already have a role for that
meeting, is assigned the role (and marked busy).

<p>(Long story short, the lists are sorted by how much you've done this role
lately.  Long story long, you get a number of "points" for being listed to do
that role at the meeting on the date in question, though of course this means
that DARTS won't be trying to assign it to anyone.  You get one-half that for
having done (or being listed to do) this role at the previous meeting, <i>or</i>
being listed to do it at the <i>next</i> meeting, one-third for <i>two</i>
meetings before or after, and so on.  You also get a little bonus on each role,
based on how busy you've been with <i>all</i> roles together.  These all get
added up to make your "rank" for this role.  The lists for each role, are then
sorted by rank.)

<p><dt>So DARTS then modifies the signup files on <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> to make
the assignments?

<p><dd>No, not really.  DARTS just tells you who to assign.  Someone with
authority to edit the rosters, has to actually do so and make the assignments.

<p><dt>Do you mean you don't need to be a delegated roster editor, to use DARTS?

<p><dd>That's right.  They have to be a member of a club using <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>, and the
club's webmaster has to have installed DARTS on their web site, but the user
doesn't have to be the webmaster or VPE or anything else special.  Ordinary
members might find it useful to figure out what it's going to be their turn to
do, soon.

<p><dt>So how <i>does</i> one install DARTS for one's club?

<p><dd>A <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/" target="_new">Toastmasters</a>
club's webmaster has to copy DARTS's HTML file (publicly available at <a
href="http://www.davearonson.com/darts/darts.html"
target="_new">http://www.davearonson.com/darts/darts.html</a> or <a
href="http://fairfax.freetoasthost.org/files/darts.html"
target="_new">http://fairfax.freetoasthost.org/files/darts.html</a>), to the
club's own file space on <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>.  (It doesn't matter whether they put it in the
public or private files.  I recommend using the private files, so that the users
must log in first.)  The admin may also want to create a configuration file,
called darts.cfg, which must be in the private files.

<p><dt>Why does it have to be copied?  Can't we just refer to the original?

<p><dd>DARTS uses AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML; don't worry if you
don't understand what that means) techniques to ask your club's <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> site for
the data.  According to the security rules of that technique, the request has to come
from the same domain as the server answering it.  In this case, that means that
the web page making the request, must be on the same site as the information
it's looking for.  The information has to come from your club's web site, so the
web page has to be on your club's web site.

<p><dt>And then, how does one use it?

<p><dd>Then, <i>any</i> member can go look at it, </i>with Javascript turned
on</i>.

<p><dt>Why is Javascript necessary?

<p><dd>Because DARTS is entirely written in JavaScript.  The HTML code that gets
copied, knows where to look for the JavaScript code and this help file.

<p><dt>It grabs Javascript code from somewhere else?  That scares me!  How do I
know it's not doing something malicious?

<p><dd>If you're worried, feel free to look in the HTML, and see where the
Javascript is coming from.  Then feel free to go look at the Javascript.  I've
tried to make it as clear as possible.  I can't guarantee that there aren't any
exploitable security holes, as I am not a web or Javscript security guru, but
feel free to have such a guru look at it.  If you find any such holes or other
defects, tell me and I'll fix it.  Nobody's found any security holes yet.

<p><dt>Okay, I'll try it.  Once I go look at it, with Javascript on, then what?

<p><dd>Then DARTS should ask your club's <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> web site for the assorted data.  It may ask you
for your username and password; these are the same ones as for your club's <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> web site.
(In fact, the request <i>is</i> really coming from your club's <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> web site.
It's doing so because DARTS is asking it for this information on your behalf,
and any attempt to get at that information makes <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> ask you to
log in.)

<p>When DARTS has all the data, it will give you a list of buttons to push for
various functions, data, and help.

<p><dt>How do I print an agenda?

<p><dd>First of course, click on "Print Agenda" from the main menu.  DARTS will then fetch your club's agenda template.

<p><dt>My club's <i>what?</i>

<p><dd>Your club's agenda template is an HTML file, called agendaTemplate.html,
in your club's private files.  It tells DARTS what you want your agenda to look
like, including some placeholders for where various bits of information about
each meeting go.  If you don't have one yet, DARTS will use a default.

<p><dt>Okay, so once it's fetched this agenda template thingy, then what?

<p><dd>Then DARTS will let you pick a date, and let you edit the agenda
template as you like.  (Unfortunately, it won't save your changes for next
time, but your site's webmaster can save a new version if needed.)  When you're
ready, you can click the button at the bottom that says "Print".  Then DARTS
will give you a new window, with an agenda in it, that you can print from your
browser.

<p><dt>So if I want to edit it, I have to know HTML?

<p><dd>Yes.  I may eventually add a WYSIWYG editor to it, but for now, you have to edit raw HTML.

<p><dt>So what are these placeholders?

<p><dd>The ones currently used are:

<p>I may add more later, depending what I can somehow extract from FTH, and maybe
establish other names for the above.  These ones here should stay good, though,
for backward compatibility.

<p><dt>How do I use the Assigner?

<p><dd>Once you push this button, DARTS will list your members, the roles you
use, and the dates for which duty rosters have been created.  Then it's a
relatively simple five-step process:

<ol>

 <p><li>Pick a date.

 <p><li>Make sure that the members checked, are those you want to consider
 eligible for assignment.  (Note: if they already have a role at that meeting,
 they won't be assigned anything else after all.)

 <p><li>Make sure that the roles checked, are the ones you want to assign.

 <p><li>Make sure that the roles are in the order you want to assign them.
 Move a role up by clicking on the word "up" beside it, and move it down
 by clicking on the word (okay, abbreviation) "dn" beside it.

 <p><li>Click the "ASSIGN ROLES!" button.

</ol>

<p><dt>What difference does it make what order the roles are assigned in?

<p><dd>Your newer members will not have filled any roles ever yet, so they will be
most likely to get assigned to a given role.  If you assign the easier roles
first, then your newer members can fill those roles, and watch how the other
roles are done, before having to fill the more advanced roles.

<p><dt>Anyhow, what happens after we click the button? 

<p><dd>Then DARTS will tell you who should fill each role that you want to
assign.

<p><dt>And... then what?

<p><dd>If you're happy with the assignments, and you're authorized to edit the
duty rosters, go ahead and enter them manually.  If you're <i>not</i> happy
with the assignments DARTS suggests, feel free to change the data they're based
on, ignore them, change them, tell DARTS to bug off, whatever.

<p><dt>Can DARTS handle custom roles?

<p><dd>Yes.

<p><dt>How?

<p><dd>Treat them just like any other.  DARTS doesn't know they're custom; it
only knows what roles <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> says you use.

<p><dt>What about roles that we have several of at each meeting, like multiple
speakers and evaluators?

<p><dd>DARTS handles them all together for purposes of building the queues, but
separately for making assignments.  So, you can't just tell it "assign all
Speakers" or "assign all Evaluators", but you can certainly tell it "assign
Speaker #1" and "assign Speaker #2" while leaving all other Speaker slots
alone.  Same for Evaluators, of course.

<p><dt>What about having assignment gaps in multiple-instance roles?
For instance, we have someone assigned to tell a joke at the beginning, someone
else assigned to tell a joke at the end, and sometimes, but not always, someone
signs up tell a joke in the middle.  We call these Joker #1, #3, and #2.  Can
we tell DARTS "assign Joker #1" and "assign Joker #3", and leave Joker #2
voluntary?

<p><dd>Yes you can!  In fact, you can even use it to extend the speaker list
with custom roles.

<p><dt>What do you mean, "extend the speaker list"?

<p><dd>The default role set has room for only four speakers and evaluators.
Say for instance you want six.  <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> allows you seven custom roles, so you can use
four of them for Speaker #5, Speaker #6, Evaluator #5, and Evaluator #6.
(Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> will not then allow you to enter the additional
information about the speeches.) 

<p><dt>And DARTS will still realize that all the Speaker #whatever are really
the same thing for the purpose of history, even though these custom ones won't
be right after the normal ones?

<p><dd>Right, so long as it ends with a space, a # sign, and a single digit.
That applies to any repeated role, be it Speaker, Evaluator, or your custom
Jokers.

<p><dt>You mentioned a configuration file.  Tell me more about that.

<p><dd>First, as I said earlier, it has to be named darts.cfg and located in the
private file storage space of your club's <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> web site.
There are four kinds of lines allowed in the file:

<ol>

 <p><li>Assignment lines have the word "assign" and the role to assign, such as:

 <p><span style="font-family:courier">
  assign Toastmaster<br>
  assign Word of the Day<br>
  assign Speaker #1<br>
 </span>

 <p>The role name must exactly match what <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
 target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> calls it.  DARTS will assign the roles in the
 same order as you list them here, unless you change it on DARTS's screen.

 <p>You cannot combine these on a single line, since a custom role name may
 contain a comma or whatever character is chosen to separate them.

 <p><li>Absence lines have the word "absent" and the name of a person who is
 absent long-term, such as:

 <p><span style="font-family:courier">absent Joe Shmoe</span>.
 
 <p>Again, the name must exactly match that used by <a
 href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>.  In this
 case it must match the "Name" in the Member Profile, not to be confused with
 the "Username", which would be in the format <span
 style="font-family:courier">"joe.shmoe"</span>.

 <p>You cannot combine these on a single line, since a name may contain a comma
 or whatever character is chosen to separate them.

 <p><li>Comments start with a # sign, such as:

 <p><span style="font-family:courier"># This is a comment</span>.

 <p><li>Blank lines have no content on them at all, or only "whitespace" (blanks
 and tabs).

</ol>

<p>You can see an example at <a
href="http://www.davearonson.com/darts/members/files/darts.cfg"
target="_new">http://www.davearonson.com/darts/members/files/darts.cfg</a> or <a
href="http://fairfax.freetoasthost.org/files/dartsSAMPLE.cfg"
target="_new">http://fairfax.freetoasthost.org/files/dartsSAMPLE.cfg</a>

<p><dt>So you can't tell DARTS who will be absent <i>when</i>?

<p><dd>No, not at this time.  I had that in there for a while, but the wide
variety of possible date formats made this very hairy.  Besides, DARTS will
usually be used for only one date at a time.  The intended use of absence lines,
is for long-term absences.  Absences on a "meeting by meeting" basis can be
handled by manually unchecking the box next to the person's name.

<p><dt>Can I use DARTS for multiple dates at once?  If I do one, will it
remember what it did, if I want to then do another?

<p><dd>No.  DARTS starts from scratch each time.  If you want to do multiple
dates, such as if your club is just starting to assign roles or has extended
how far out it assigns, you have to manually enter each date and reload DARTS
before doing the next date.

<p><dt>What do you mean, "reload" DARTS?

<p><dd>Press control-R (or on a Mac, command-R), to tell your browser to reload
the page.  (At least, that will work on Netscape and its assorted derivatives
like Mozilla and Firefox.  On Explorer, ironically enough, that won't work; you
have to hit control-N to make it open a new window, though that will
automagically load DARTS into it too.)

<p><dt>Why is that necessary?

<p><dd>It makes DARTS ask <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> for the information again.  That's the only way
it can get the updates you will have just made.  Maybe I'll put in an easier
way later....

<p><dt>If I have trouble, who do I call?

<p><dd>Nobody.  Nobody pays me the big bucks necessary for me to provide 24/7
phone tech support for this!  But, you can go to the <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> tech
support forum on <a href="http://www.igroops.com/" target="_new">iGrOOps</a>,
register if you haven't yet, and either post in the forum, or send me a private
message.  (Please only do that if your problem involves private information!
Otherwise, please post in the Support Requests forum, so that other people can
learn from it too.)

<p><dt>Oh, so this <i>is</i> a part of <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a>?

<p><dd>Not quite.  If it messes up, don't blame Bo.  It's entirely my own
fault, er, creation.  The connection with <a
href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/" target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> is that it
uses the data that <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> stores.  So, it won't work elsewhere, but it's
an add-on that I am solely responsible for.

<p><dt>Is there any more direct way I can get in touch with you?

<p><dd>I'd very much prefer you didn't, since going to <a
href="http://www.igroops.com/" target="_new">iGrOOps</a> means that you're much
more likely to read the questions other people have asked, and their answers,
so I don't have to repeat myself.  But, if you really feel that posing your
question there, whether in the <a href="http://www.freetoasthost.org/"
target="_new">FreeToastHost</a> tech support forum or in a private message,
just won't do, you can send me email.

<p><dt>So what's your address?

<p><dd>I don't give out an address.  There are two ways you can contact me:

<ol>

<p><li>Use <a
href="http://htmlgear.tripod.com/feed/control.feed?a=render&i=1&u=davearonson"
target="_new">this form</a>, but you <i>must</i> remember to fill in your own
email address, so I can send a reply, and preferably a subject line, so I know
it isn't spam!

<p><li>Take your own name, remove the spaces, and tack on 2Dave.  (Also remove
any other characters that aren't legal in email addresses.  If you're not sure,
stick to letters and numbers.)  For example, if you're Jean D'Eaux, you'd get
JeanDEaux2Dave.  Then, send it to that username at my main domain, which is <a
href="http://www.davearonson.com/" target="_new">davearonson.com</a>.  (No, I'm
not going to put it all together for you; it's an antispam device, so that would
defeat the purpose.)

</ol>

<p><dt>What features are you working on, or at least considering?

<dd><ul>

<p><li>Marking people as "reliable", and certain roles as "only assign to
reliable people".

<p><li>Restricting Evaluator to people who have spoken.  (Possibly a
configurable number of times, and possibly with exceptions.)

<p><li>A button on the Assigner, that would write the assignments to the club's
data files.  Unfortunately, they seem to have some security in place that makes
that impossible, but there may be a way around it.

<p><li>Reporting who, in a given timeslice, has done each role a given number of
times.  For example, you could ask it "over the past year, who has spoken at
least twice, evaluated at least twice, and done everything else at least once?".

</ul>
