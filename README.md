DARTS: Dave Aronson's Role Tracking System

This is, or rather *was*, a system for Toastmasters clubs to use to
keep track of whose turn it was to do what role at what meeting, based
on when they had *last* done what, and when they had signed up (or
were assigned) to do what in the near future.  It depended on data
retrieved from FreeToastHost 1.0, which is no longer available, having
been suddenly replaced by the completely incompatible 2.0.  So now,
DARTS resides here as a sample of what my JavaScript skills were like
back around 2007 to 2009.

It was initially an offline program written in Python.  I decided to
translate it into JavaScript so that people could use it more easily,
simply copying the HTML into their own club's file space, rather than
copying the Python code, copying the hidden data files from
FreeToastHost, running the Python program (possibly preceded by
installing Python), and then interpreting the results.

But never fear, you can still see what it looked like in operation.
See the scereenshots.
